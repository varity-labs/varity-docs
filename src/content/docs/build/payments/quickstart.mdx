# Payments Quick Start

Monetize your app through the Varity App Store. Set your price, deploy, and earn revenue automatically.

<Aside type="caution" title="Beta Limitation">
Credit card payments are not available during beta (development environment). Apps can use the free tier. Paid tiers with credit card support will be available after production launch.
</Aside>

## How Monetization Works

1. **Build your app** using Varity SDK
2. **Set your pricing** (free, one-time, or subscription)
3. **Deploy and submit** to the Varity App Store
4. **Earn revenue** with a 90/10 split (you keep 90%)

Users discover your app in the Varity App Store and purchase it directly.

## Revenue Split

When users purchase your app or subscribe:

- **90%** goes to you (the developer)
- **10%** goes to the Varity platform

This is handled automatically by Varity's backend. You receive payouts monthly.

## Quick Setup

<Steps>

1. **Deploy your app**

   ```bash
   varitykit app deploy --submit-to-store
   ```

2. **Set pricing in the App Store**

   After submission, configure your pricing in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.store.varity.so):
   - Free tier
   - One-time purchase
   - Monthly subscription

3. **Users purchase your app**

   Users find your app in the [Varity App Store](https://store.varity.so) and purchase it.

4. **You earn revenue**

   Revenue is automatically split 90/10 and deposited to your account.

</Steps>

## Adding Payment UI (Post-Beta)

Once credit card payments are available, you can add a payment widget to your app:

```tsx title="components/UpgradeButton.tsx"
import { PaymentWidget } from '@varity-labs/ui-kit';

export function UpgradeButton({ appId }) {
  return (
    <PaymentWidget
      appId={appId}
      amount={10}  // $10 USD
      onSuccess={(result) => {
        console.log('Payment complete!', result);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Subscription Tiers Example

Structure your app pricing with tiers:

```tsx title="components/PricingPage.tsx"
import { PaymentGate } from '@varity-labs/ui-kit';

const TIERS = [
  { name: 'Starter', price: 0, features: ['5 projects', 'Basic analytics'] },
  { name: 'Growth', price: 29, features: ['50 projects', 'Advanced analytics', 'API access'] },
  { name: 'Business', price: 99, features: ['Unlimited projects', 'Priority support', 'Custom domain'] },
];

export function PricingPage({ appId }) {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      {TIERS.map((tier) => (
        <div key={tier.name} className="border rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">{tier.name}</h3>
          <p className="text-3xl font-bold mt-2">
            {tier.price === 0 ? 'Free' : `$${tier.price}/mo`}
          </p>
          <ul className="mt-4">
            {tier.features.map((f) => (
              <li key={f} className="flex items-center gap-2">
                <span className="text-green-500">✓</span> {f}
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
          {tier.price > 0 && (
            <PaymentGate
              appId={appId}
              tier={tier.name.toLowerCase()}
              amount={tier.price}
              onSuccess={() => console.log(`Subscribed to ${tier.name}`)}
            />
          )}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Payment Flow

Here is what users experience:

1. **Find your app** in the Varity App Store
2. **Choose a plan** (free, one-time, or subscription)
3. **Complete payment** via the App Store checkout
4. **Access your app** immediately after purchase

<Aside type="tip">
Users pay in their local currency using familiar payment methods. No special setup required on their end.
</Aside>

## Next Steps

- [Free Operations](/build/payments/gasless) - Users never pay usage fees
- [Deploy Your App](/deploy/varity-l3) - Submit to the App Store

Common questions from developers new to Varity.

## General

### What is Varity?

Varity is an application deployment platform that provides:
- **Secure hosting** - Your app runs on distributed infrastructure
- **Built-in authentication** - Email, Google, Twitter login out of the box
- **Zero usage fees** - Users never pay operational fees
- **70-85% cost savings** compared to AWS and traditional cloud

### How is Varity different from AWS/Vercel/Netlify?

| Feature | Traditional Cloud | Varity |
|---------|------------------|--------|
| Infrastructure | Centralized servers | Distributed network |
| Pricing | Pay for compute time | Pay for what you use |
| User fees | N/A | $0 (sponsored) |
| Vendor lock-in | High | None (open standards) |
| Data ownership | Provider controlled | You control |

### Is my data secure?

Yes. Varity uses:
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Distributed storage (no single point of failure)
- Open-source code you can audit

### What frameworks are supported?

- Next.js 13+ (App Router)
- React (Vite or Create React App)
- Vue 3+
- Node.js backends
- Any static site generator

## Deployment

### How do I deploy my app?

```bash
# Install the CLI
pip install varitykit

# Deploy
varitykit app deploy
```

See the [Quick Start](/getting-started/quickstart) guide for full details.

### What hosting options are available?

| Static | Dynamic (Coming Soon) |
|--------|----------------------|
| Static websites | Full-stack applications |
| Marketing pages, docs | Apps with backend logic |
| Free | Pay for compute resources |

### Can I rollback a deployment?

Yes:

```bash
varitykit app rollback deploy-1737492000
```

This creates a new deployment with your previous configuration.

### Where is my app hosted?

Your app is hosted on Varity's secure, distributed infrastructure with global CDN delivery. Files are replicated across multiple regions for reliability.

## Authentication

### How do users log in?

Users can log in with:
- Email (magic link -- no password needed)
- Google, Twitter, Discord, GitHub

No special knowledge required for users.

### Do I need to set up authentication myself?

No. Add `PrivyStack` to your app and authentication works automatically:

```tsx
import { PrivyStack } from '@varity-labs/ui-kit';

<PrivyStack appId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VARITY_APP_ID}>
  {children}
</PrivyStack>
```

### What user data can I access?

- Email address
- Display name
- Profile picture (from social login)
- Linked accounts (Google, Twitter, etc.)

All data is accessible via the `usePrivy()` hook.

## Costs and Pricing

### How much does Varity cost?

During beta, Varity is **free to use**.

After production launch:
- **Static hosting**: Free
- **Dynamic hosting**: Based on compute resources used
- **App Store listing**: Platform takes 10% of app revenue

### Do my users pay usage fees?

**No.** All operational fees are sponsored by Varity. Users never see or pay operational costs.

### How does the 90/10 revenue split work?

When users purchase your app or pay for subscriptions:
- **90%** goes to you (the developer)
- **10%** goes to the Varity platform

This is better than Apple App Store (70/30) or Google Play (70/30).

## Technical

### Do I need any special infrastructure knowledge?

**No.** Varity abstracts all infrastructure complexity:
- Users log in with email (standard login flow)
- No usage fees or tokens to manage
- Standard JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
- Familiar React components

The infrastructure is invisible -- you do not interact with it directly.

### Can I use my existing database?

Yes. Varity does not replace your database. You can:
- Use any database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Host your database anywhere
- Connect via standard database drivers

Varity also provides a built-in database module via `@varity-labs/sdk`. See the [Database Quick Start](/build/databases/quickstart).

### What are the SDK package sizes?

- `@varity-labs/sdk`: ~50KB gzipped
- `@varity-labs/ui-kit`: ~120KB gzipped
- `@varity-labs/types`: ~5KB gzipped

All packages support tree-shaking for smaller bundles.

## Troubleshooting

### My deployment failed

1. Run `varitykit doctor` to check your setup
2. Check your build works locally: `npm run build`
3. See [Troubleshooting](/resources/troubleshooting) for more help

### Authentication is not working

1. Ensure `PrivyStack` wraps your app
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Contact [support@varity.so](mailto:support@varity.so) if your domain needs to be allowed

### I cannot find my deployment

```bash
# List all deployments
varitykit app list

# Check latest status
varitykit app status
```

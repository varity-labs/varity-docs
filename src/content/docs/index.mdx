## Why Varity?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="60-Second Deploy" icon="rocket">
    From code to production in one command. No infrastructure to manage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="70-85% Cost Savings" icon="seti:dollar">
    Pay $800/mo instead of $2,800/mo for typical workloads. Decentralized infrastructure is cheaper.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Zero Blockchain Knowledge" icon="puzzle">
    Your users login with email. Pay with credit card. No wallets, no gas fees, no confusion.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Web2 Developer Experience" icon="laptop">
    React components, familiar APIs, TypeScript support. If you know React, you know Varity.

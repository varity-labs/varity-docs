# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions from developers new to Varity.

## General

### What is Varity?

Varity is an application deployment platform that provides:
- **Decentralized hosting** - Your app runs on distributed infrastructure, not a single server
- **Built-in authentication** - Email, Google, Twitter login out of the box
- **Zero transaction fees** - Users never pay network fees
- **70-85% cost savings** compared to AWS and traditional cloud

### How is Varity different from AWS/Vercel/Netlify?

| Feature | Traditional Cloud | Varity |
|---------|------------------|--------|
| Infrastructure | Centralized servers | Distributed network |
| Pricing | Pay for compute time | Pay for what you use |
| User fees | N/A | $0 (sponsored) |
| Vendor lock-in | High | None (open standards) |
| Data ownership | Provider controlled | You control |

### Is my data secure?

Yes. Varity uses:
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Distributed storage (no single point of failure)
- Open-source code you can audit

### What frameworks are supported?

- Next.js 13+ (App Router)
- React (Vite, Create React App)
- Vue 3+
- Node.js backends
- Any static site generator

## Deployment

### How do I deploy my app?

```bash
# Install CLI
pip install varitykit

# Deploy
varitykit app deploy --hosting ipfs
```

See [Quick Start](/getting-started/quickstart) for the full guide.

### What's the difference between IPFS and Akash hosting?

| IPFS | Akash |
|------|-------|
| Static websites | Dynamic applications |
| Marketing pages, docs | Apps with backend logic |
| Free | Pay for compute resources |
| "Website" link on App Store | "Launch App" link on App Store |

### Can I rollback a deployment?

Yes:

```bash
varitykit app rollback deploy-1737492000
```

This creates a new deployment with your previous configuration.

### Where is my app hosted?

- **IPFS deployments**: Distributed across IPFS nodes worldwide via thirdweb Storage
- **Akash deployments**: Decentralized compute providers on the Akash Network

## Authentication

### How do users log in?

Users can log in with:
- Email (magic link - no password needed)
- Google, Twitter, Discord, GitHub
- Crypto wallets (optional)

No blockchain knowledge required for users.

### Do I need to set up authentication myself?

No. Add `PrivyStack` to your app and authentication works automatically:

```tsx
import { PrivyStack } from '@varity/ui-kit';

<PrivyStack appId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VARITY_APP_ID}>
  {children}
</PrivyStack>
```

### What user data can I access?

- Email address
- Display name
- Profile picture (from social login)
- Linked accounts (Google, Twitter, etc.)

All data is accessible via the `usePrivy()` hook.

## Costs & Pricing

### How much does Varity cost?

During testnet, Varity is **free to use**.

After mainnet launch:
- **Static hosting (IPFS)**: Free
- **Dynamic hosting (Akash)**: Based on compute resources used
- **App Store listing**: Platform takes 30% of app revenue

### Do my users pay transaction fees?

**No.** All network fees are sponsored by Varity. Users never see or pay transaction costs.

### How does the 70/30 revenue split work?

When users purchase your app or pay for subscriptions:
- **70%** goes to you (the developer)
- **30%** goes to the Varity platform

This is similar to Apple App Store or Google Play.

## Technical

### What is Varity L3?

Varity L3 is the network where your app is registered. It's:
- **Chain ID**: 33529
- **Fast**: Sub-second confirmations
- **Cheap**: Fractions of a cent per transaction
- **Gasless**: Users never pay fees

### Do I need to know blockchain/crypto?

**No.** Varity abstracts all blockchain complexity:
- Users log in with email (not crypto wallets)
- No gas fees or tokens to manage
- Standard JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
- Familiar React components

The blockchain is infrastructure - you don't interact with it directly.

### Can I use my existing database?

Yes. Varity doesn't replace your database. You can:
- Use any database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Host your database anywhere
- Connect via standard database drivers

Varity handles hosting, auth, and payments - not data storage.

### What's the SDK size?

- `@varity/sdk`: ~50KB gzipped
- `@varity/ui-kit`: ~120KB gzipped
- `@varity/types`: ~5KB gzipped

All packages support tree-shaking for smaller bundles.

## Troubleshooting

### My deployment failed

1. Run `varitykit doctor` to check your setup
2. Ensure `THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID` is set
3. Check your build works locally: `npm run build`
4. See [Troubleshooting](/resources/troubleshooting) for more help

### Authentication isn't working

1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID` is set
2. Check your domain is allowed in Privy dashboard
3. Ensure `PrivyStack` wraps your app

### I can't find my deployment

```bash
# List all deployments
varitykit app list

# Check latest status
varitykit app status
```

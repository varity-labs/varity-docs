Varity is the easiest way to build, deploy, and monetize real-world applications. **No special infrastructure knowledge required.**

```bash
npm install @varity-labs/sdk @varity-labs/ui-kit
varitykit deploy
```

**That's it.** Your app is now running with:
- Authentication (email, social login)
- File storage (secure, globally distributed)
- Payments (App Store monetization)
- Free operations (users never pay usage fees)

## What Makes Varity Different?

### For Developers

If you have built apps with React, Next.js, or any modern framework, you **already know how to use Varity**.

- **Familiar login** - Users log in with email or social accounts
- **No usage fees** - All operational costs are handled automatically
- **Standard APIs** - Just familiar TypeScript APIs and React components
- **70-85% cheaper** than AWS, GCP, or Azure

### Seamless User Experience

Your users experience a normal web app.

- Login with email or Google (no extra prompts)
- Pay with credit card (standard checkout)
- Instant operations (no confirmation screens)
- Works exactly like any other web app

import { PrivyStack, PrivyLoginButton } from '@varity-labs/ui-kit';

function App() {
  return (
    <PrivyStack appId={process.env.VARITY_APP_ID}>
      <PrivyLoginButton />
      <YourApp />
    </PrivyStack>
  );
}

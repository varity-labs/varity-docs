# Environment Variables

Varity manages most credentials automatically. You only need to set environment variables for services you manage yourself.

<Aside type="tip">
**No credential setup required.** Authentication and storage credentials are provided automatically by Varity. See [Managed Credentials](/deploy/managed-credentials) for details.
</Aside>

## Varity App Configuration

```bash title=".env.local"
# Your Varity App ID (from developer portal)
NEXT_PUBLIC_VARITY_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

## Optional Variables

These variables are only needed for specific use cases:

| Variable | Required For | Default |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_VARITY_APP_ID` | App identity | Dev default |
| `VARITY_API_URL` | Custom API endpoint | `https://api.varity.io` |
| `VARITY_API_KEY` | API authentication | Auto-provided |
| `AKASH_WALLET_KEY` | Akash deployments | Not set |
| `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` | Contract deployments | Not set |

### Akash Deployments

Required only for deploying dynamic applications:

```bash title=".env"
AKASH_WALLET_KEY=your_akash_wallet_private_key
```

<Aside type="caution">
Never commit your `AKASH_WALLET_KEY` to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
</Aside>

## Example .env Files

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Development">
    ```bash title=".env.local"
    # Varity SDK (optional — dev defaults work automatically)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_VARITY_APP_ID=your-app-id
    ```

    In development, the SDK uses shared credentials automatically. No other variables are needed.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Production">
    ```bash title=".env.production"
    # Varity SDK
    NEXT_PUBLIC_VARITY_APP_ID=your-app-id
    VARITY_API_URL=https://api.varity.io
    VARITY_API_KEY=your_production_api_key

    # Akash (for dynamic app deployment)
    AKASH_WALLET_KEY=your_akash_wallet_key
    ```

    Production credentials for authentication and storage are auto-provided by the CLI during deployment.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Framework-Specific Prefixes

Different frameworks require different prefixes for client-side variables:

| Framework | Prefix | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Next.js | `NEXT_PUBLIC_` | `NEXT_PUBLIC_VARITY_APP_ID` |
| Vite | `VITE_` | `VITE_VARITY_APP_ID` |
| Create React App | `REACT_APP_` | `REACT_APP_VARITY_APP_ID` |

## Security Best Practices

<Aside type="danger">
**Never expose secret keys in client-side code.** Only use `_PUBLIC_` prefixed variables for client-side access.
</Aside>

### Do:
- Use `.env.local` for local development (git-ignored)
- Store production secrets in your CI/CD platform
- Rotate keys regularly

### Don't:
- Commit `.env` files with real credentials
- Use production keys in development
- Share API keys in public repositories
- Hardcode secrets in source code

## Verifying Configuration

Run the doctor command to verify your configuration:

```bash
varitykit doctor
```

This checks:
- Credential availability (auto-provided or manually set)
- Network connectivity
- API key validity
- Project structure

## Troubleshooting

### Variables not loading

1. Check file name is exactly `.env` or `.env.local`
2. Restart your development server after changes
3. Verify no syntax errors in the file
4. Check framework-specific prefixes (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `VITE_`, etc.)

### Credentials not working

Run `varitykit doctor` to diagnose. Credentials are auto-provided — if they fail, check your network connection.

<Accordion title="Advanced: Using Your Own Credentials">

**Varity manages these credentials automatically. Only use this if you need custom configuration.**

Override managed credentials by setting these variables:

```bash title=".env.local"
# Authentication — get from https://dashboard.privy.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=your_privy_app_id

# Storage — get from https://thirdweb.com/dashboard
THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your_thirdweb_client_id
THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY=your_thirdweb_secret_key
```

Framework-specific variants:

```bash
# Next.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id

# Vite
VITE_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id

# Create React App
REACT_APP_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
```

When these are set, the SDK and CLI use your credentials instead of the managed ones.

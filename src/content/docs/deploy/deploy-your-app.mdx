# Deploy Your Application

Deploy your application to Varity with one command. Your app will be live in under 2 minutes.

:::note[Beta Environment]
Varity is currently in beta. Your deployments work exactly as in production, but with test data.
:::

## Quick Deploy

<Steps>

1. **Install the CLI**

   ```bash
   pip install varitykit
   ```

2. **Build your project**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy**

   ```bash
   varitykit app deploy
   ```

4. **Your app is live!**

   Varity will output your live URL:

   ```
   ✓ Deployed successfully!
   ✓ URL: https://your-app.varity.app
   ✓ Build time: 1m 23s
   ✓ Status: Live
   ```

</Steps>

## What Happens During Deployment

When you run `varitykit app deploy`:

1. **Detects your framework** - Automatically identifies Next.js, React, Vue, etc.
2. **Builds your app** - Runs your build command (`npm run build`)
3. **Uploads your files** - Stores them securely with automatic backups
4. **Makes your app live** - Generates a public URL
5. **Enables free operations** - Users never pay usage fees

All of this happens automatically in under 2 minutes.

## Hosting Options

Choose the right hosting for your application type:

</CardGrid>

## Before You Deploy

### Environment Variables

Credentials are managed automatically by Varity. Optionally set your app ID:

```bash title=".env.local"
# Optional: Your Varity App ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_VARITY_APP_ID=<your-app-id>

# Optional: Custom domain
VARITY_CUSTOM_DOMAIN=your-domain.com
```

See [Environment Variables](/deploy/env-variables) for the complete list and [Managed Credentials](/deploy/managed-credentials) for how credential auto-provision works.

### Test Locally First

Always test your build works locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and verify everything works.

## Publish to App Store

List your app in the Varity App Store for users to discover:

```bash
varitykit app deploy --submit-to-store
```

This will:
1. Deploy your app
2. Submit it for listing in the App Store
3. Make it discoverable by users
4. Enable payments and subscriptions (optional)

### Revenue Share

When users purchase your app or subscribe:

- **90%** goes to you (the developer)
- **10%** goes to the Varity platform

All payment processing is handled automatically. You receive payouts monthly.

## Manage Your Deployments

### List All Deployments

View your deployment history:

```bash
varitykit app list
```

Output:
```
ID                  Status    URL                              Deployed
deploy-1737491000   live      https://your-app.varity.app      2 hours ago
deploy-1737484800   archived  https://v2.your-app.varity.app   1 day ago
deploy-1737398400   archived  https://v1.your-app.varity.app   2 days ago
```

### Rollback to Previous Version

Revert to a previous deployment:

```bash
varitykit app rollback deploy-1737484800
```

Your app will instantly switch to the selected version.

### View Deployment Details

Check the details of a specific deployment:

```bash
varitykit app info deploy-1737491000
```

### Check Deployment Status

View overall deployment status:

```bash
varitykit app status
```

## Custom Domains

:::note[Coming Soon]
Custom domain support is under development. Your apps will be available at Varity-generated URLs during beta.
:::

## Troubleshooting

### "Deployment failed: Build error"

1. Verify your build works locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Check the build output directory exists:
   - Next.js: `.next/` or `out/`
   - React: `dist/` or `build/`
   - Vue: `dist/`

### "Environment variables not found"

Credentials are auto-provided. If you see this error, run `varitykit doctor` to check your setup.

### "Deployment timed out"

Check your internet connection:

```bash
varitykit doctor
```

If issues persist, try deploying with verbose output:

```bash
varitykit app deploy --verbose
```

## Storage Architecture

Static deployments use:
- **IPFS** for content-addressed storage
- **Filecoin** for long-term archival
- **CDN** for global distribution

Dynamic deployments use:
- **Akash Network** for distributed compute
- **Persistent volumes** for databases
- **Load balancing** across multiple providers

## Deployment Flow (Technical)

1. **Build** - CLI detects framework and runs build
2. **Upload** - Files uploaded to IPFS, deployment ID generated
3. **Register** - App registered via `VarityAppRegistry`
4. **Paymaster** - Free operations enabled via `SimplifiedPaymaster`
5. **CDN** - Files propagated to global CDN

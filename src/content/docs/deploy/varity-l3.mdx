# Deploy Your App

Deploy your application to Varity with one command. Your app will be live in under 2 minutes.

<Aside type="note">
**Beta** - Varity is currently in beta. Your deployments work exactly as in production, but with test data.
</Aside>

## Quick Deploy

<Steps>

1. **Install the CLI**

   ```bash
   pip install varitykit
   ```

2. **Build your project**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy**

   ```bash
   varitykit app deploy
   ```

4. **Your app is live!**

   Your app is now live at the URL shown in the terminal.

</Steps>

## What Happens During Deployment

When you run `varitykit app deploy`:

1. **Detects your framework** - Automatically identifies Next.js, React, Vue, etc.
2. **Builds your app** - Runs your build command (`npm run build`)
3. **Uploads your files** - Stores them securely with automatic backups
4. **Makes your app live** - Generates a public URL
5. **Enables free operations** - Users never pay usage fees

All of this happens automatically in under 2 minutes.

## Hosting Options

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Static Sites" icon="document">
    Static websites, SPAs, documentation, landing pages. Free hosting with global CDN.

    Full-stack apps, APIs, databases. Container-based compute with automatic scaling.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Environment Variables

Credentials are managed automatically by Varity. No manual setup needed for deployment.

See [Environment Variables](/deploy/env-variables) for optional configuration and [Managed Credentials](/deploy/managed-credentials) for how it works.

## Submit to App Store

Submit your app for listing in the Varity App Store:

```bash
varitykit app deploy --submit-to-store
```

This will:
1. Deploy your app
2. Register it on Varity's infrastructure
3. Submit to the App Store for review

## Revenue Split

When users purchase your app or pay for subscriptions:

- **90%** goes to you (the developer)
- **10%** goes to the Varity platform

This is handled automatically. You receive payouts monthly.

## Verify Your Deployment

After deployment, check status:

```bash
varitykit app list
```

## Rollback

Revert to a previous deployment:

```bash
varitykit app rollback deploy-1737491000
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Deployment failed"

Run `varitykit doctor` to diagnose. Credentials are auto-provided — if deployment fails, check your network connection.

### "Build failed"

1. Verify your build works locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Check the build output directory exists

### "Registration failed"

Check network connectivity:

```bash
varitykit doctor
```

## Deployment Flow (Technical)

1. **Build** - CLI detects framework and runs build
2. **Upload** - Files uploaded to secure storage, deployment ID generated
3. **Register** - App registered via `VarityAppRegistry`
4. **Paymaster** - Free operations enabled via `SimplifiedPaymaster`
5. **CDN** - Files propagated to global CDN

# Payments Quick Start

<Aside type="caution" title="Beta: Limited Payment Methods">
Varity is in beta. During beta, payments are processed via the App Store checkout only. Credit card payments (Stripe, Apple Pay) are coming soon. You can still set pricing, submit your app, and earn revenue — users pay through the App Store.
</Aside>

Monetize your app through the Varity App Store. Set your price, deploy, and earn revenue automatically.

## Revenue Model

When users purchase your app or subscribe:

| Recipient | Share | Details |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **You** (developer) | **90%** | Deposited to your account monthly |
| **Varity** (platform) | **10%** | Covers hosting, infrastructure, and distribution |

This is handled automatically. No payment integration code required on your end.

## How It Works

<Steps>

1. **Build your app** using Varity SDK

2. **Deploy and submit** to the Varity App Store

   ```bash
   varitykit app deploy --submit-to-store
   ```

3. **Set your pricing** in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.store.varity.so)

   Choose from:
   - **Free** — no charge, great for building an audience
   - **One-time purchase** — users pay once for lifetime access
   - **Monthly subscription** — recurring revenue

4. **Users discover and purchase** your app on [store.varity.so](https://store.varity.so)

5. **You earn revenue** — 90% of every payment, deposited monthly

</Steps>

## Pricing Tiers

Structure your app with multiple tiers to capture different customer segments:

```typescript title="Example pricing structure"
const TIERS = [
  {
    name: 'Starter',
    price: 0,
    features: ['5 projects', 'Basic analytics'],
  },
  {
    name: 'Growth',
    price: 29,
    features: ['50 projects', 'Advanced analytics', 'API access'],
  },
  {
    name: 'Business',
    price: 99,
    features: ['Unlimited projects', 'Priority support', 'Custom domain'],
  },
];
```

Configure these tiers in the Developer Portal after submitting your app.

## What Works During Beta

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| App submission to store | Available |
| Set pricing tiers (free, one-time, subscription) | Available |
| 90/10 revenue split | Available |
| App Store checkout | Available |
| Monthly payouts | Available |
| Credit card payments (Stripe, Apple Pay) | Coming soon |
| In-app payment widget | Coming soon |

## In-App Payments (Coming Soon)

After beta, you'll be able to add payment UI directly in your app:

```tsx title="components/UpgradeButton.tsx"
// Coming soon — not yet available during beta
import { PaymentWidget } from '@varity-labs/ui-kit';

export function UpgradeButton({ appId }) {
  return (
    <PaymentWidget
      appId={appId}
      amount={10}  // $10 USD
      onSuccess={(result) => {
        console.log('Payment complete!', result);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

<Aside type="note">
During beta, all payments go through the App Store checkout. The `PaymentWidget` component will be available for in-app payments after the production launch.
</Aside>

## User Experience

What your users see:

1. **Find your app** in the Varity App Store
2. **Choose a plan** (free, one-time, or subscription)
3. **Complete payment** via the App Store checkout
4. **Access your app** immediately after purchase

Users pay in their local currency using familiar payment methods. No special setup required on their end.

## Next Steps

- [Free Operations](/build/payments/gasless) — Users never pay usage fees
- [Deploy Your App](/deploy/varity-l3) — Submit to the App Store

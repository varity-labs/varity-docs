# Build & Deploy a SaaS App in 5 Minutes

This tutorial takes you from zero to a live SaaS application. You'll scaffold a project, explore what's included, and deploy it.

## What You'll Build

A project management app with:
- Landing page for marketing
- User authentication (email + social login)
- Dashboard with projects, tasks, and team management
- Full CRUD operations with optimistic UI
- Mobile-responsive layout

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.8+
- npm, pnpm, or yarn

## Step-by-Step

<Steps>

1. **Install the CLI**

   ```bash
   pip install varitykit
   ```

   Verify it works:

   ```bash
   varitykit doctor
   ```

   You should see all checks passing:
   ```
   ✓ Python version: 3.11.0
   ✓ Node.js version: 20.0.0
   ✓ npm version: 10.0.0
   ✓ All checks passed!
   ```

2. **Scaffold the project**

   ```bash
   varitykit init my-saas-app
   cd my-saas-app
   ```

   This creates a Next.js project from the SaaS Starter template.

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the dev server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

   You'll see a landing page. Click "Get Started" to go to the login page, then sign in with your email. After login, you'll see the dashboard.

5. **Explore the dashboard**

   Try these:
   - **Projects**: Create a project, edit its status, delete it
   - **Tasks**: Add tasks, change priorities, mark as done
   - **Team**: Add team members, assign roles
   - **Cmd+K**: Open the command palette to search across everything

   All data operations use optimistic updates — the UI updates instantly, then syncs with the database.

6. **Build for production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This creates a static export in the `out/` directory.

7. **Deploy**

   ```bash
   varitykit app deploy
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   Analyzing your app...
     ✓ Detected: Next.js app (static)
     ✓ Building and uploading...

   Deploying...
     ████████████████████ 100%

   ✓ Deployed successfully!
   ✓ Live at: https://your-app-url.varity.app
   ```

   Your app is now live. Share the URL with anyone.

8. **Submit to the App Store (optional)**

   To list your app for users to discover:

   ```bash
   varitykit app deploy --submit-to-store
   ```

   This opens the Developer Portal where you can:
   - Set your app name and description
   - Choose pricing (free, one-time, or subscription)
   - Upload screenshots
   - Publish to [store.varity.so](https://store.varity.so)

</Steps>

## What Just Happened?

When you deployed, Varity:

1. **Built** your Next.js app into static files
2. **Deployed** to globally distributed hosting
3. **Injected** database credentials automatically
4. **Enabled** authentication (users can sign in immediately)
5. **Made it discoverable** (if you submitted to the App Store)

Total time: about 60 seconds for the deploy step.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a live app, you can:

- [Customize the template](/tutorials/customize-template) — Change branding, colors, and content
- [Add a new feature](/tutorials/add-crud-feature) — Add a new data model with full CRUD
- [Set up payments](/build/payments/quickstart) — Monetize your app with 90/10 revenue split

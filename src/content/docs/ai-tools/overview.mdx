# AI Tools for Varity

Varity provides AI tooling to help you build faster. Copy a prompt into your AI assistant, and it already knows how to build, deploy, and debug Varity apps.

## Available Tools

## Quick Start: AI Prompts

The fastest way to get AI assistance with Varity is to copy one of our [AI Prompts](/ai-tools/prompts) into your project.

**For Cursor:**
1. Download the Varity rules file
2. Save to `.cursor/rules/varity.mdc` in your project
3. Cursor now understands Varity patterns automatically

**For Claude Code:**
1. Copy the prompt content from our [AI Prompts page](/ai-tools/prompts)
2. Add to your project's `CLAUDE.md` file
3. Claude Code now has full Varity context

**For any AI assistant:**
1. Copy the prompt from [AI Prompts](/ai-tools/prompts)
2. Paste at the start of your conversation
3. Ask it to build features using Varity

## Cursor Rules

Pre-configured rules that teach Cursor IDE how to write Varity code correctly.

**Available rules:**
- **Varity App Development** — SDK patterns, database queries, auth setup
- **Deployment** — CLI commands, environment variables, hosting options
- **Authentication** — Privy setup, protected routes, user data
- **Database** — Collections, typed queries, CRUD hooks

**Install:**

```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
# Download from the AI Prompts page
```

See the [AI Prompts page](/ai-tools/prompts) for the full rules file content.

## LLM-Optimized Documentation

AI assistants can reference our documentation in a machine-readable format:

```
https://docs.varity.so/llms.txt
```

This file contains a structured summary of Varity: what it is, key APIs, CLI commands, and common patterns. Point any AI tool at this URL for instant Varity context.

## AI-Friendly Patterns

Our tools teach AI assistants these patterns:

### Infrastructure Abstraction

AI assistants are trained to use developer-friendly language:

- "Deploy your application" (not "upload to IPFS")
- "Sign in" (not "connect wallet")
- "Usage fees are covered" (not "gasless transactions")

### Type Safety

```typescript
import { db } from '@varity-labs/sdk';
import type { Project } from '../types';

// Always use typed collections
const projects = db.collection<Project>('projects');
```

### Error Handling

```typescript
try {
  await projects.add(data);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'VALIDATION_ERROR') {
    // Handle specific error
  }
}
```

## Supported AI Tools

| Tool | Integration | Level |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Cursor** | `.mdc` rules + prompts | Full |
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` + prompts | Full |
| **Windsurf** | Cursor-compatible rules | Full |
| **Claude Desktop** | MCP Server (Coming Soon) | Planned |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `llms.txt` context | Basic |

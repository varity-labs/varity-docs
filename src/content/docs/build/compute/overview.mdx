# Compute

<Aside type="caution">
**Coming Soon** - Compute features are under active development and will be available before MVP launch.
</Aside>

Run backend services, scheduled jobs, and server-side code on distributed infrastructure.

## What's Coming

### Distributed Compute

Deploy containers and backend services:

- **Container hosting** - Run any Docker container
- **Auto-scaling** - Scale based on demand
- **Global distribution** - Deploy close to users
- **70-85% cheaper** - Compared to traditional cloud

### Use Cases

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="API Backends" icon="server">
    Run Express, FastAPI, or any backend framework
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scheduled Jobs" icon="seti:clock">
    Cron jobs, data processing, reports
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI/ML Workloads" icon="star">
    Run inference, training, embeddings
  </Card>
  <Card title="Databases" icon="seti:db">
    Host PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Current Status

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Static hosting | Available |
| Dynamic hosting | Coming Soon |
| Serverless functions | Planned |
| Scheduled jobs | Planned |
| GPU compute | Planned |

## Early Access

Want early access to compute features? Deploy with:

```bash
varitykit app deploy --hosting akash
```

<Aside type="note">
The `--hosting akash` flag is available in the CLI but compute features are still being finalized.
</Aside>

## Architecture Preview

When compute launches, you'll be able to:

```bash
# Deploy a Next.js app with backend
varitykit app deploy --hosting dynamic

# Deploy and submit to App Store
varitykit app deploy --hosting dynamic --submit-to-store
```

## Cost Comparison

| Workload | AWS | Varity (Akash) | Savings |
|----------|-----|----------------|---------|
| Small API | $50/mo | ~$15/mo | 70% |
| Medium app | $200/mo | ~$50/mo | 75% |
| AI workload | $500/mo | ~$100/mo | 80% |

*Estimates based on typical usage patterns*

## Available Now

While compute is coming soon, you can already:

- [Deploy static sites](/deploy/varity-l3) - Static hosting is live
- [Set up authentication](/build/auth/quickstart) - Full auth available
- [Add payments](/build/payments/quickstart) - Payment processing works
- [Use storage](/build/storage/quickstart) - File storage ready

## Next Steps

- [Deploy Your App](/deploy/varity-l3) - Deploy static apps now
- [CLI Overview](/cli/overview) - Available CLI commands

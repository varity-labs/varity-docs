# Why Varity

Deploy production-ready applications in minutes, not weeks. Pay 70-85% less than AWS. No DevOps expertise required.

## The Problem with Traditional Cloud

Traditional cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure are powerful but come with significant drawbacks:

- **Complex pricing** - Hidden costs, unpredictable bills, hundreds of services to understand
- **Infrastructure management** - Configure load balancers, manage databases, set up CDNs
- **DevOps overhead** - Requires dedicated engineers just to maintain infrastructure
- **Vendor lock-in** - Difficult and expensive to migrate once you're committed

**Cost example**: A typical application with 100 users, database, storage, and AI features costs ~$2,800/month on AWS.

## The Varity Advantage

Varity provides the same capabilities at a fraction of the cost and complexity.

### 70-85% Cost Savings

Deploy the same application for ~$800/month instead of ~$2,800/month. Our distributed infrastructure eliminates cloud markup while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability.

| Feature | AWS Cost | Varity Cost | Savings |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Hosting + Database | $1,200/mo | $300/mo | 75% |
| Storage (1TB) | $800/mo | $200/mo | 75% |
| AI/LLM queries | $600/mo | $200/mo | 67% |
| CDN + Functions | $200/mo | $100/mo | 50% |
| **Total** | **$2,800/mo** | **$800/mo** | **71%** |

### One-Command Deployment

No server configuration. No infrastructure setup. Just deploy.

```bash
varitykit app deploy
```

Your application is live in under 2 minutes with:
- Automatic scaling
- Built-in authentication
- Secure file storage
- Payment processing
- Analytics dashboard

### Built for Web2 Developers

If you know React, Next.js, Vue, or any modern framework, you already know how to use Varity.

**No special infrastructure knowledge required:**
- Users sign in with email or social accounts (no wallet required)
- Accept credit card payments (no crypto needed)
- Standard APIs you already know (no jargon)
- Instant operations (no confirmation screens)

Your users will never know the app runs on secure, distributed infrastructure.

### Everything You Need, Built In

Stop stitching together dozens of services. Varity includes everything out of the box:

| Feature | Traditional Stack | Varity |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Authentication** | Auth0, Clerk, Firebase Auth | Built-in (email, social, optional wallet) |
| **Storage** | AWS S3, Cloudflare R2 | Built-in (encrypted, distributed) |
| **Payments** | Stripe integration | Built-in (credit card on-ramp) |
| **Analytics** | Google Analytics, Mixpanel | Built-in AI dashboard |
| **Hosting** | Vercel, Netlify, AWS | Built-in (static + dynamic) |

### Maximum Security by Default

Your data is encrypted end-to-end. Even we can't read it.

- **Encryption at rest** - All stored data is encrypted
- **Encryption in transit** - TLS for all connections
- **Client-side encryption** - Optional key management for maximum privacy
- **No central point of failure** - Distributed infrastructure

Perfect for healthcare, finance, and any application handling sensitive data.

## When to Use Varity

Varity is ideal for:

- **Startups** - Get to market fast without DevOps overhead
- **Side projects** - Don't break the bank on infrastructure
- **Enterprise applications** - Save 70% on cloud costs while maintaining security
- **Advanced apps** - Build sophisticated experiences without infrastructure complexity
- **Sensitive data** - Healthcare, finance, or any regulated industry

## When NOT to Use Varity

Varity may not be the best fit if you:

- Need extreme customization of infrastructure (bare metal access)
- Already have a large AWS investment with reserved instances
- Require specific compliance certifications not yet supported (contact us for roadmap)
- Are building a product that requires direct low-level infrastructure control

For most applications, Varity provides everything you need at a fraction of the cost.

# Templates

Varity templates are complete, production-ready apps you can customize and deploy. Start with a template instead of building from scratch.

## Available Templates

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="SaaS Starter" icon="rocket">
    A full-stack SaaS application with authentication, database, dashboard, and team management.

    **Includes:** Landing page, login, dashboard with 5 pages, mobile responsive layout, command palette, CRUD operations.

    **Stack:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Privy Auth, Varity Database

  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How Templates Work

Templates are scaffolded using the CLI:

```bash
varitykit init my-app
```

This creates a new project directory with:
- All source code (yours to modify)
- Dependencies pre-configured
- Auth, database, and deployment ready
- No lock-in — it's a standard Next.js project

## Template vs. Manual Setup

| Feature | Template | Manual Setup |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Auth | Pre-configured | Add `PrivyStack` yourself |
| Database | Collections + hooks ready | Set up `db.collection()` yourself |
| Dashboard | 5 pages with CRUD | Build from scratch |
| Mobile nav | Included | Build from scratch |
| Landing page | Included | Build from scratch |
| Time to deploy | ~5 minutes | ~1 hour |

<Aside type="tip">
Even if you plan to heavily customize, starting from the template saves time. It demonstrates all the patterns (collection helpers, hooks, protected routes) that you can adapt to your needs.

## Customizing Templates

After scaffolding, the code is yours. Common customizations:

1. **Branding** — Change app name, colors, logo
2. **Data models** — Replace Project/Task with your domain objects
3. **Pages** — Add, remove, or modify dashboard pages
4. **Navigation** — Edit the sidebar items

See the [SaaS Starter](/templates/saas-starter) page for detailed customization guides, or follow the [Customize the Template](/tutorials/customize-template) tutorial.

## Coming Soon

More templates are planned:

- **E-commerce Starter** — Product catalog, cart, checkout
- **Blog / Content** — CMS with markdown editor
- **Admin Panel** — Data management dashboard

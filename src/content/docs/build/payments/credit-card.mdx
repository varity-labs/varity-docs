# Credit Card Payments

Let users pay for your app using credit cards, Apple Pay, or Google Pay through the Varity App Store.

<Aside type="caution" title="Beta Limitation">
Credit card payments are not available during beta (development environment). Apps can use the free tier. Paid tiers with credit card support will be available after production launch.
</Aside>

## How It Works

1. User finds your app in the Varity App Store
2. User clicks "Purchase" or "Subscribe"
3. Secure checkout opens with familiar payment options
4. Payment is processed automatically
5. Revenue is split 90/10 (you keep 90%)

Users never need special accounts or knowledge. They just pay with their card.

## Setting Up Pricing

Configure your app pricing in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.store.varity.so):

| Pricing Model | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Free** | No charge. Great for building an audience. |
| **One-time** | Single purchase. User gets lifetime access. |
| **Subscription** | Monthly recurring payment. |

## In-App Payments (Post-Beta)

Once credit card payments are available, add payment components directly in your app:

```tsx title="components/UpgradeButton.tsx"
import { PaymentWidget } from '@varity-labs/ui-kit';
import { usePrivy } from '@varity-labs/ui-kit';

export function UpgradeButton() {
  const { user } = usePrivy();

  if (!user) {
    return <p>Please log in to upgrade</p>;
  }

  return (
    <PaymentWidget
      appId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VARITY_APP_ID}
      amount={50}
      buttonText="Upgrade to Pro - $50"
      onSuccess={(result) => {
        console.log('Upgrade complete!', result);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Full Checkout Page (Post-Beta)

For a complete payment experience:

```tsx title="pages/checkout.tsx"
import { PaymentGate } from '@varity-labs/ui-kit';
import { usePrivy } from '@varity-labs/ui-kit';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

export default function CheckoutPage() {
  const { user, authenticated } = usePrivy();
  const router = useRouter();

  if (!authenticated) {
    router.push('/login');
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div className="max-w-md mx-auto py-8">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Upgrade Your Plan</h1>

      <PaymentGate
        appId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VARITY_APP_ID}
        amount={100}
        tier="business"
        onSuccess={(result) => {
          if (result.status === 'completed') {
            router.push('/dashboard?upgraded=true');
          }
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Payment Methods (Post-Beta)

| Method | Availability |
|--------|--------------|
| Credit/Debit Card | All users |
| Apple Pay | iOS/macOS users |
| Google Pay | Android/Chrome users |

## Revenue Split

When users purchase your app:

- **90%** goes to you (the developer)
- **10%** goes to the Varity platform

Revenue is tracked in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.store.varity.so).

<Aside type="tip">
**No setup needed for payments** - The Varity App Store handles all payment processing, compliance, and payouts. You just set your price.

## Next Steps

- [Free Operations](/build/payments/gasless) - Users never pay usage fees
- [Authentication Quick Start](/build/auth/quickstart) - Set up user accounts

Varity is the easiest way to build and deploy real-world applications on decentralized infrastructure. **No blockchain knowledge required.**

```bash
npm install @varity/sdk @varity/ui-kit
varitykit deploy
```

**That's it.** Your app is now running on decentralized infrastructure with:
- Authentication (email, social, wallet)
- File storage (IPFS)
- Payments (credit card on-ramp)
- Gasless transactions (users never pay fees)

## What Makes Varity Different?

### For Web2 Developers

If you've built apps with React, Next.js, or any modern framework, you **already know how to use Varity**.

- **No crypto wallets** - Users login with email or social accounts
- **No gas fees** - All transaction costs are handled automatically
- **No blockchain jargon** - Just familiar APIs and components
- **70-85% cheaper** than AWS, GCP, or Azure

### Seamless User Experience

Your users will never know the app runs on blockchain technology.

- Login with email or Google (no wallet popups)
- Pay with credit card (no crypto purchases)
- Instant transactions (no confirmation screens)
- Works exactly like any other web app

## Quick Example

Here's how simple it is to add authentication to your React app:

```tsx
import { PrivyStack, PrivyLoginButton } from '@varity/ui-kit';

function App() {
  return (
    <PrivyStack appId={process.env.VARITY_APP_ID}>
      <PrivyLoginButton />
      <YourApp />
    </PrivyStack>
  );
}
```

Users can now log in with:
- Email (magic link)
- Google, Twitter, Discord
- Any crypto wallet (optional)

## Why Varity?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="One-command deploy" icon="rocket">
    Run `varitykit deploy` and your app is live. No servers to configure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="70-85% cost savings" icon="seti:dollar">
    Secure infrastructure costs less. Pay ~$800/mo instead of ~$2,800/mo.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Zero complexity" icon="puzzle">
    Users log in with email and pay with credit cards. No extra setup needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Familiar tools" icon="laptop">
    React, TypeScript, and APIs you already know. Infrastructure complexity stays hidden.
  </Card>

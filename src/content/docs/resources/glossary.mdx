A guide to terms used in Varity documentation, translated for developers familiar with traditional web development.

<Aside type="tip">
Varity abstracts most blockchain concepts. You rarely need to understand the underlying technology, but this glossary helps if you encounter unfamiliar terms.
</Aside>

## Core Concepts

### App Store (Varity App Store)

The marketplace where users discover and install Varity applications. Similar to the Apple App Store or Google Play, but for web applications.

**Key points:**
- Submit your app with `varitykit app deploy --submit-to-store`
- 70/30 revenue split (you keep 70%)
- View the store at [store.varity.so](https://store.varity.so)

### Chain ID

A unique identifier for a network. Varity L3's Chain ID is `33529`.

**Web2 equivalent:** Like a region code or environment identifier (production, staging, etc.)

### CID (Content Identifier)

A unique fingerprint for content stored on IPFS. Any change to the content produces a different CID.

**Web2 equivalent:** Like a content hash or version hash. Think of it as a URL based on the content itself.

```
Example CID: bafybeihdwdcefgh4dqkjv67uzcmw7ojee6xedzdetojuzjevtenxquvyku
```

### Gasless Transactions

Transactions where the user doesn't pay network fees. Varity sponsors all fees, so users never need tokens.

**Web2 equivalent:** Free API calls - the platform covers the infrastructure cost.

### smart wallet (Smart Account)

An advanced user account with programmable features. Created automatically when users sign up.

**Web2 equivalent:** User account with enhanced security features (2FA, spending limits, session management).

### Varity L3

The Arbitrum Orbit rollup where Varity apps are registered. "L3" means Layer 3 - a fast network optimized for applications.

**Web2 equivalent:** Varity's production infrastructure. You deploy here like you'd deploy to AWS.

## Hosting Terms

### IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

A distributed file storage network. Files are stored across multiple nodes worldwide.

**Web2 equivalent:** A global CDN that's not controlled by any single company. Like S3 + CloudFront, but decentralized.

**Use case:** Static websites, images, documents

### Akash Network

A decentralized cloud computing marketplace. Providers compete to run your application.

**Web2 equivalent:** Like AWS EC2 or Heroku, but you're choosing from multiple competing providers.

**Use case:** Dynamic applications, APIs, databases

### DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network)

A network of distributed compute resources. Akash is a DePIN.

**Web2 equivalent:** Multi-cloud architecture where resources come from independent providers.

## Authentication Terms

### Magic Link

A passwordless login method. Users click a link sent to their email.

**Web2 equivalent:** Same as "magic link" in Auth0, Slack, or Medium.

### Privy

The authentication service used by Varity. Provides email, social, and wallet login.

**Web2 equivalent:** Like Auth0 or Firebase Auth, but with additional login options.

### Session

A temporary authentication state. Created when users log in, and expired when they log out.

**Web2 equivalent:** Standard browser session, stored in localStorage.

## Development Terms

### thirdweb

The infrastructure provider for blockchain interactions. Handles storage, transactions, and more.

**Web2 equivalent:** Like Firebase or Supabase - a backend-as-a-service for apps.

### Client ID

A public identifier for your thirdweb project. Used for API calls.

**Web2 equivalent:** Like an API key or project ID in Firebase/Google Cloud.

### SDK (Software Development Kit)

The `@varity/sdk` package that provides all Varity functionality.

```bash
npm install @varity/sdk
```

### UI Kit

The `@varity/ui-kit` package with pre-built React components.

```bash
npm install @varity/ui-kit
```

## Deployment Terms

### Build Artifacts

The compiled output of your application (e.g., the `dist/` or `build/` folder).

### Deployment ID

A unique identifier for each deployment:

```
deploy-1737492000
```

Use this to track, rollback, or reference deployments.

### Manifest

A JSON file describing your deployment:

```json
{
  "deployment_id": "deploy-1737492000",
  "network": "varity",
  "hosting": "ipfs",
  "cid": "bafybei..."
}
```

### Rollback

Reverting to a previous deployment version.

```bash
varitykit app rollback deploy-1737492000
```

## Financial Terms

### Revenue Split

How revenue is divided between you and the platform:
- **70%** to developer
- **30%** to Varity

### USDC

The currency used on Varity L3. It's a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.

**Web2 equivalent:** Just think of it as USD. $1 USDC = $1 USD.

<Aside type="note">
USDC on Varity uses 6 decimal places (not 18 like some cryptocurrencies).

$1.00 = 1,000,000 units
$0.01 = 10,000 units

## Term Translations

Quick reference for blockchain-to-web2 translations:

| Blockchain Term | Web2 Equivalent |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Smart contract | Backend API / serverless function |
| Wallet | User account |
| Gas fees | Transaction costs (free on Varity) |
| On-chain | Deployed / Hosted |
| Decentralized | Distributed / Multi-region |
| Token | In-app currency |
| Mint | Create |
| Burn | Delete |
| Block | Batch of operations |
| Node | Server |

<Aside type="tip">
When reading Varity docs, you can usually replace blockchain terms with their Web2 equivalents and the meaning stays the same.

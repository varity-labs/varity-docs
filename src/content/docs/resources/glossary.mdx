A guide to terms used in Varity documentation.

## Core Concepts

### App Store (Varity App Store)

The marketplace where users discover and use Varity applications. Similar to the Apple App Store or Google Play, but for web applications.

**Key points:**
- Submit your app with `varitykit app deploy --submit-to-store`
- 90/10 revenue split (you keep 90%)
- View the store at [store.varity.so](https://store.varity.so)

### Deployment ID

A unique identifier for each deployment:

```
deploy-1737492000
```

Use this to track, rollback, or reference deployments.

### Free Operations

Operations where the user does not pay usage fees. Varity sponsors all costs, so users never need to pay.

**Equivalent:** Free API calls -- the platform covers the infrastructure cost.

### Smart Account

An advanced user account with programmable features. Created automatically when users sign up.

**Equivalent:** User account with enhanced security features (2FA, spending limits, session management).

## Authentication Terms

### Magic Link

A passwordless login method. Users click a link sent to their email.

**Equivalent:** Same as "magic link" in Auth0, Slack, or Medium.

### Privy

The authentication service used by Varity. Provides email, social, and additional login options.

**Equivalent:** Like Auth0 or Firebase Auth.

### Session

A temporary authentication state. Created when users log in, expired when they log out.

**Equivalent:** Standard browser session, stored in localStorage.

## Development Terms

### Client ID

A public identifier for your project. Used for API calls.

**Equivalent:** Like an API key or project ID in Firebase/Google Cloud.

### SDK (Software Development Kit)

The `@varity-labs/sdk` package that provides all Varity functionality.

```bash
npm install @varity-labs/sdk
```

### UI Kit

The `@varity-labs/ui-kit` package with pre-built React components.

```bash
npm install @varity-labs/ui-kit
```

## Deployment Terms

### Build Artifacts

The compiled output of your application (e.g., the `dist/` or `build/` folder).

### Manifest

A JSON file describing your deployment:

```json
{
  "deployment_id": "deploy-1737492000",
  "network": "varity",
  "hosting": "static"
}
```

### Rollback

Reverting to a previous deployment version.

```bash
varitykit app rollback deploy-1737492000
```

## Financial Terms

### Revenue Split

How revenue is divided between you and the platform:
- **90%** to developer
- **10%** to Varity

### USDC

The currency used on Varity. It is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.

**Equivalent:** Just think of it as USD. $1 USDC = $1 USD.

<Aside type="note">
USDC on Varity uses 6 decimal places.

$1.00 = 1,000,000 units
$0.01 = 10,000 units
</Aside>

## Hosting Terms

### Static Hosting

Files are stored securely and distributed globally via CDN.

**Equivalent:** Like S3 + CloudFront or Netlify.

**Use case:** Static websites, SPAs, documentation

### Dynamic Hosting (Coming Soon)

Container-based compute for full-stack applications.

**Equivalent:** Like AWS EC2 or Heroku.

**Use case:** APIs, databases, server-side rendering

### Chain ID

A unique identifier for a network. Varity's Chain ID is `33529`.

**Equivalent:** Like a region code or environment identifier.

### IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

A distributed file storage network. Files are stored across multiple nodes worldwide.

**Equivalent:** A global CDN with content-addressed URLs.

### Akash Network

A distributed cloud computing marketplace. Providers compete to run your application.

When reading Varity docs, you can usually replace technical terms with their everyday equivalents and the meaning stays the same.
